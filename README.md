#### The goal of this project is to practice and understand working with constructors,prototypes,objects,properties and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation & traversal.
#### By George Wayne Mwangi
## Description.
This is a web application of a pizza place where customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings.The following are expectations as a user:
* Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large
* Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
* Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
* Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
* Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
* Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
* If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
* See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
## Requirements
* Determine the prices for each pizza size.
* Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
* Determine the cost for the crust
* The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
* On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.
##Project objectives
* The project code uses constructors in Javascript.
* The project makes use of prototypes in Javascript.
* The project implements one or more Javascript functions.
* The project separates the business logic code from the UI logic code.
* The web app uses bootstrap and media queries to make it fully responsive.
* The javascript code uses the correct syntax of camel case naming of variables. I.e var myVariable = "stores something"; instead of var my_var = "stores something", or, var MyVar = "stores something" , or,  var my-Var = "stores something"
##Technical Requirements
* The project should contain a well-documented README markdown file.
* The project should be visually appealing and polished in a portfolio quality state.
* The project should contain regular git commits with appropriate commit messages associated with them.
* The working project should be deployed and the link to the live site provided in the Github repository.
* The project code should be pushed to Github.
* The project code should be consistently indented, neat and easy to read through.
## Setup.
* Create a project folder on your desktop.
* Use git clone https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/FourthWeekIP.git on your terminal in the project folder
* Open index.html file on your browser

## Technologies used.
  * Html5
  * Css
  * Javascript
  * Bootstrap
  * Markdown


## Known Bugs
* When placing another order, the total is not computed for all orders combined.
* The order page is not responsive.(working on it)
